# Technocolabs â€” Canvas Exact Export

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript project that embeds the **exact JSX** you uploaded as the app.
TailwindCSS, framer-motion, and lucide-react are set up because your component uses them.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

- The production output will be in `/dist`.
- Deploy the contents of `/dist` to any static host.
